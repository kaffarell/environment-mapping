# environment-mapping
Maps the surrounding space with an ultrasonic sensor and a rotary encoder.
Currently the range is up to 4 meter and there is only horizontal pivoting.

## Todo:
 * [x] Rotary Encoder driver code  
 * [ ] Ultrasonic sensor driver code  
 * [x] Server to receive data (rocket.rs)  
 * [ ] Implement Visualization (OpenGL - kiss3d)    
 * [ ] Motor instead of rotary encoder  
 * [ ] Vertical Pivoting
